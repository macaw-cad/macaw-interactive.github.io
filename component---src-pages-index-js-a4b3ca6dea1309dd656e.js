The “Forking with feature branches workflow” is one workflow that has been adopted by a very large crowd of open-source developers, including us.</p>\n<p>This workflow is characterised by the fact that each of the developers working on the project is based on two repositories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The main, common repository, which is the central place for every developer, called upstream</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>His own repository, which is the clone of the main one, called a fork and is also known as origin</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are a lot of advantages to this workflow, such as very thoughtful code merging, which can be watched by a chosen person (and could be the only person having the permissions to modify the main repository). Another is pull requests, which let developers perform code reviews with ease.</p>\n<p><img src="'+a(262)+'" alt="MI Git workflow"></p>\n<h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work</h2>\n<h3 id="create-a-new-repository-on-the-organization-level">Create a new repository on the organization level</h3>\n<p>This is done on Github.
